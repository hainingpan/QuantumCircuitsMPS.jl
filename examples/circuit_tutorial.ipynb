    "# Circuit Tutorial - QuantumCircuitsMPS.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the Circuit API workflow for building, visualizing, and simulating quantum circuits in QuantumCircuitsMPS.jl. The Circuit API provides a lazy/symbolic representation that separates circuit construction from execution, enabling visualization and inspection before running expensive simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build**: Circuit created with do-block syntax (lazy/symbolic)\n",
    "2. **Visualize**: SVG diagrams without execution\n",
    "3. **Simulate**: Deterministic execution with explicit RNG seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use the Circuit API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✓ Inspect circuit structure before expensive simulation\n",
    "- ✓ Reuse same circuit with different initial states\n",
    "- ✓ Export circuit diagrams for documentation/papers\n",
    "- ✓ Separate logical structure from execution details"
