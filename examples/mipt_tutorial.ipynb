    "# MIPT Tutorial - Measurement-Induced Phase Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the **Measurement-Induced Phase Transition (MIPT)** in a 1D quantum circuit with random unitary gates and projective measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MIPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIPT arises from a competition between two processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unitary evolution** (Haar random gates): Creates entanglement between qubits\n",
    "2. **Projective measurements** (Z-basis): Destroys entanglement locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the measurement rate, the system exhibits two distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume-law phase** (p < p_c ≈ 0.16): Entanglement entropy scales with system size S ~ L\n",
    "- **Area-law phase** (p > p_c ≈ 0.16): Entanglement entropy remains constant S ~ const\n",
    "- **Critical point** (p ≈ p_c): Logarithmic scaling S ~ log(L)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurement vs Reset: A Critical Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measurement(:Z)**: Pure projective measurement - qubit collapses to |0⟩ or |1⟩ and stays there\n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each timestep consists of three operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Bricklayer(:odd)` - Haar random gates on pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), ...\n",
    "2. `Bricklayer(:even)` - Haar random gates on pairs (2,3), (4,5), (L,1), ...\n",
    "3. Z-measurements - Each site measured with probability p using `Measurement(:Z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This Bricklayer pattern ensures all qubits are entangled before measurements occur."
