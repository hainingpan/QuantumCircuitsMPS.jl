# I₃(A:B:C) = I(A:B) + I(A:C) − I(A:BC) — the standard Gullans–Huse MIPT
# convention, composed from three MutualInformation evaluations, so it
# inherits MutualInformation's per-backend dispatch (MPS, state vector,
# Clifford, Gaussian) and its region constraints/size guards. There is no
# TMI-specific backend code: any backend that implements MutualInformation
# — the fermionic Gaussian backend included — gets I₃ by composition.

    TripartiteMutualInformation(A, B, C; renyi_index=1, threshold=1e-16, base=ℯ)

Tripartite mutual information I₃ = I(A:B) + I(A:C) − I(A:BC) between three
site regions (Gullans–Huse MIPT convention).

Each region must be a CONTIGUOUS, non-empty range of physical sites, the
three regions must be pairwise DISJOINT, and `B ∪ C` must itself be
contiguous (i.e. B and C adjacent) — inherited from `MutualInformation`'s
contiguous-region constraint on the I(A:BC) term. Note that A and C need NOT
be adjacent: I(A:C) uses `MutualInformation`'s two disjoint blocks.

# Sign convention (MIPT usage)
The standard diagnostic partitions the chain into four QUARTERS A, B, C, D
and computes I₃(A:B:C) with D traced out — NOT equal thirds of the whole
system: for ANY pure state, a full tripartition (A∪B∪C = everything) gives
I₃ ≡ 0 identically, so it carries no information (useful only as a
consistency check). With a fourth region traced out, scrambled volume-law
states give I₃ ≤ 0 (the MIPT scrambling diagnostic), while e.g. GHZ-type
global correlations give I₃ > 0: GHZ(L=8) with A=1:2, B=3:4, C=5:6
(D=7:8 traced) gives I₃ = +log 2.

# Arguments
- `A`, `B`, `C`: the three site regions (contiguous, pairwise disjoint,
  B and C adjacent)
- `renyi_index::Real=1`, `threshold::Float64=1e-16`, `base::Real=ℯ`:
  forwarded UNVALIDATED to all three `MutualInformation` terms, which perform
  the normalize-then-validate check (any `Real`, normalized to `Float64`, and
  the normalized value must be finite and > 0; `Bool` rejected). See
  `MutualInformation`'s docstring; Rényi-n I₃ for real n ≠ 1 is a diagnostic,
  not a proper mutual information.

# Backend cost
Inherits `MutualInformation`: on the MPS backend the largest term I(A:BC)
requires d^(|A|+|B|+|C|) ≤ 256 (e.g. ≤ 8 qubits combined); state vector is
exact dense (L ≲ 20); Clifford is poly-time; Gaussian is three
covariance-submatrix eigendecompositions per term, O((|A|+|B|+|C|)³).

Under `bc = :periodic` every backend reads the three regions as PHYSICAL
sites (inherited from `MutualInformation`), so I₃ is cross-backend
unambiguous — unlike `EntanglementEntropy`'s MPS `cut`, which is a RAM bond
index of the folded MPS.

# Examples
```julia
tmi = TripartiteMutualInformation(1:2, 3:4, 5:6)   # quarters of L=8
value = tmi(state)
track!(state, :I3 => TripartiteMutualInformation(1:2, 3:4, 5:6; base=2))
