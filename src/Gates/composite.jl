    Measurement(axis::Symbol)

Pure projective measurement in the specified basis.

- `Measurement(:Z)` - Z-basis measurement: projects to |0⟩ or |1⟩ based on Born probability

This is a FUNDAMENTAL operation. Unlike `Reset`, measurement leaves the qubit
in the measured state (|0⟩ or |1⟩) without resetting it.

# Physics
1. Compute Born probability P(0|ψ) for the qubit
2. Sample outcome ∈ {0, 1} according to Born rule
3. Apply projection operator to collapse wavefunction
4. Normalize the state

# Example
```julia
apply!(state, Measurement(:Z), SingleSite(1))  # Measure qubit 1 in Z-basis
apply!(state, Measurement(:Z), AllSites())     # Measure all qubits
```

    Reset

Reset gate: projects to |0⟩ or |1⟩ based on Born probability, then flips to |0⟩ if needed.
Equivalent to measure + conditional X.
